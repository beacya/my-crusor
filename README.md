# My Experience Using Crusor for Web Development: From 0 to 1 is Fast, From 1 to 100 is Hard

## Background

As a backend developer with over a decade of experience, my front-end skills are quite limited. I am still stuck in the jQuery era and have barely touched modern frameworks like Vue. Over the years, front-end technology has evolved rapidly, leaving me unfamiliar with the latest advancements.

Recently, I started using **Crusor** to develop websites, and the results have been astonishing. It allowed me to build **seven websites in seven days**â€”ranging from simple single-page apps to more complex sites. It's like a dream come true, even faster than a product manager changing requirements.

## From 0 to 1: Rapid MVP Development

The biggest advantage of **Crusor** is its ability to **drastically speed up** the process of bringing a product from **0 to 1**. Once I have an idea, I simply describe it in a way that the AI can understand. For example:

> "Generate a regex testing website with an input box for regex, a results section with syntax highlighting, various language code examples, and common regex use cases. Use the Vue framework."

At this point, Crusor takes the stage. After a few rounds of interaction, I get a functional prototype within minutes. The features are all there, and it looks like a real product. However, the design **often doesnâ€™t match what I envision**, so most of the time is spent tweaking styles and debugging.

From idea, to **buying a domain, generating code, modifying styles, and launching**â€”the entire process takes just a few hours. I once completed a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP) in only two hours**. For someone unfamiliar with modern front-end frameworks, this speed is unbelievable.

Crusor's **prompt-based development** allows me to generate code **without diving deep into front-end intricacies**. Layouts, component structure, and logic are all handled by AI. I just need to **clearly describe** what I want, and it delivers. This first step is incredibly satisfyingâ€”it feels like playing God, commanding the AI with just words.

## From 1 to 100: The Painful Optimization Process

However, once I entered the **refinement stage**, problems began to emerge. The effort required for **fine-tuning** was much greater than expected. 

For example, when working on a **mobile wallpaper generator**, I had to tweak it **dozens of times**, mostly adjusting styles. When I asked Crusor to "fix the layout," it **completely changed the entire template**, causing various errors. 

Sometimes, it even **lost track of files**, creating new ones instead of modifying existing ones. Over time, this led to confusion, and in the end, it **never achieved the exact effect I wanted**â€”wasting a lot of time. 

If I had **explicitly specified** the file and the exact changes, it would have been much easier. But since I'm **not very familiar with front-end development**, I often tried to **let AI handle everything**. This laziness **led to disaster**â€”after hours of careful tweaks, Crusor could wipe everything **in seconds**. At times, I wanted to punch someoneâ€”but who do I punch? ðŸ˜­

Fortunately, **Crusor now has a version control feature**, allowing me to **restore previous versions** when things go wrong. So, I forgive it... for now. At least it knows it makes mistakes.

### Key Challenges in Optimization

1. **Logical Confusion**  
   AI lacks **an overall understanding** of the project and may make changes that **break existing functionality**.

2. **Repeated Attempts**  
   Some features require **dozens of retries** to generate a satisfactory result, consuming **significant time and energy**.

3. **Loss of Context**  
   AI struggles to fully understand the context of the code, often requiring **manual guidance and corrections**.

This **1-to-100 phase** made me deeply aware of AIâ€™s current limitations. While it is a powerful **code generation assistant**, **fine-tuning still requires human intervention**. The thrill of **creation from scratch** fades, replaced by the grind of debugging.

## Final Thoughts

My experience with **Crusor** has been a mix of excitement and frustration. The **0-to-1 phase** is **incredibly fast**, making it feel like an extension of my brainâ€”**having an idea and seeing it built in minutes**. However, the **1-to-100 phase** exposes the current **limitations of AI tools**, requiring **continuous manual adjustments**.

That said, without Crusor, I **wouldnâ€™t have been able to build seven projects in a week**â€”and certainly not with such **polished UI designs**.

As AI technology continues to evolve, it may **become an even stronger assistant** or even **fully replace manual coding in some areas**. But for now, **developers and entrepreneurs alike should embrace these tools**. Whether for **building new products** or **offloading tedious tasks**, itâ€™s worth trying.

Before AI replaces us, let's **make it work for us** first. ðŸš€
